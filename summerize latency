# LatencyTest.sh - a shell script that runs a ping test to constantly measure network latency.

# Usage: sh LatencyTest.sh [ -p host-to-ping ] [ -t duration ]

# Options:
# -p | --ping: Host to ping to measure latency (default - gstatic.com)
# -t | --time: Duration for how long the ping test should run - (default - 60 seconds)

PINGHOST="gstatic.com"
